# Algorithms

Welcome to my Algorithms repository!

This page lists the mathematics, data structures and algorithms I will study over the coming 6 months or less. There are far too many so I'll focus on this.

If you see an essential topic missing from this list, or an extraneous one that's a programmer is not likely to need, please email me at Sathyaish@gmail.com.

If you'd like to hire me, please do the same.

At present, I feel like a lost ball in the high weeds, not knowing how to make sense of algorithmic complexity analysis and lacking in Math as well. I knew a lot of Math until my early college days but I’ve since forgotten it all and am trying to learn it all again.

I’ve made many attempts in the past that have led only to frustration. I hope I’ll see the light some day. Just that I don’t know where to start, so my study effort is presently very unorganized, not in terms of my own self-discipline but in terms of where to start and how much of it should I learn.

I’ve been making an inventory of what math topics to study in what order and then what data structures and algorithms to study. Here is a list. Could you please see if the order is the right one and if there’s anything I must add or remove from this list?

It isn’t that I am totally unfamiliar with all of it. I kind of know and remember a little bit of all of it from my college days. Also, the data structures are something I am fairly conversant with as I have used them regularly over the last 19 or so years that I’ve been programming. Also, I’ve practiced more or less of this assortment over and over many years ago and intermittently been practicing them over the years but I need to restart afresh with a strict, formal regime.
